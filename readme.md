# Saddle Up!
### Use a RAML definition to put a Saddle on your API!

(very early dev).

Who likes creating test harnesses for their APIs? *Not this guy.*
It's a fuss, and such a pain to keep in line with your actual API.

Saddle Up hopes to change this. Saddle Up uses a RAML definition to
create a light front-end webapp to sit on top of your API. All the pain of creating
the test harness is removed! More time for ~~beer~~ developing.

RAML is a [RESTful API Modeling Language](http://raml.org) - or simply a really neat way for you to describe your API.
